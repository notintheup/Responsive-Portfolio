        <img src="assets/images/IMG_0665.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

        <p>I am a senior management leader working to build my cloud-centric developer
          portfolio by learning code, the logic behind it and how to efficiently write it. I am
          currently working full-time and attending The Coding Boot Camp at UNC Charlotte part-time
          with plans to build mind-blowing serverless functions with my new found knowledge. <br><br>
          In summary, I am an I.T. professional with cross-functional
          expertise in daily operations of enterprise and delivery platforms
          including primary responsibilities in architecting/operating solutions on AWS,
          on-premise to cloud migrations and distributed applications as well as deep
          architectural discussions with executives, IT management and developers.</p>
