      <div id="me">I am an senior management leader working to build my cloud-centric developer
        portfolio by learning code, the logic behind it and how to efficiently write it. I am 
        currently working full-time and attending The Coding Boot Camp at UNC Charlotte part-time 
        with plans to build mind blowing serverless functions with my new found knowledge. <br><br>
        In summary, I am an I.T. professional with cross-functional 
        expertise in daily operations of enterprise and delivery platforms 
        including primary responsibilities in architecting/operating solutions on AWS, 
        on-premise to cloud migrations and distributed applications as well as deep 
        architectural discussions with executives, IT management and developers.</span>
